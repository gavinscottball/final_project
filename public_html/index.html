<!--

NOTE: This is what I am thinking to be the splash page when entering our IP. clicking login will take you
to the log in page which will then bring you to the game and the rest of the site it is currently
"linked" but i am unsure if this is what we need to be doing or not

I think all you need to do here is just link the login button since 
I already handled it being the splash screen

In the other HTML files I have a nav bar that links to all the pages with <a> links
I dont know if we will need to change that or not. In client I found a way to make sure 
that the DOM doesnt interact with the wrong things.

        <p class="description">PLACEHOLDER - Our overall goal for this project is to create an interactive website for users that are interested in
                video games and competing against other players. The vision for the website is to feel like a mix
                of old-school video game forums (think of speedrun.com) and web browser gaming sites (think
                of coolmathgames.com) but for the game we will be designing for our website. We plan to have
                various pages you can navigate to with each serving their own purposes to help users understand
                the functionality of our webpage.
                The features of the website we want to focus on the most are the social and interactable elements.
                We plan to have a page where users can make attempts at our game and compete for the highest
                scores. This will be accompanied by an additional webpage that will show high scores for all
                users that have played the game on the site. We plan to include an area where users can interact
                with one another by leaving comments on the game and scores that others are achieving. We are
                going to implement these using techniques learned in class, along with additional modules to aid
                in our game design.</p>
